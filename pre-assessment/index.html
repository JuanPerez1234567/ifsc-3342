      <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
      <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="Most interesting Man in the world" class="img-right">The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often,
        simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a
        complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
      <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced
        to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish
        too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination
        of it.</p>
